The second MS. belongs to Sir John Lawson, Bart, who has Ἴ
very kindly placed it at the disposal oi the Society. ⁴

Its date seems to be an. 1403. It contains a Paschal Tablc
which commences with the note: “ Notandum, quod ista tabula
Paschae incipit Anno Domini millesimo quadringentesimo tertio.”

It contains not only the usual Offices of the Manual (with the
exception of that for the Purification of Women), but also Offices
or parts of Offices which would regularly appear in the Breviary,
Missal, or Processional. It has also a Galendar and a Paschal
Table.

The volume is perfect, in admirable condition, with an illumi·
nation at the “Te igitur '' in the “Missa de Trinitate” in the
Maniage office. The Music is most carehrlly written.

'l'he parts of the book which belong to the Breviary are the ’
Seven Penitential Psalmo, Litany and Collects following, and
Psalms 22-30. Το the Missal a number of occasional and votive
messes, with Offices for the Purification, Aah Wednesday, Palm
Sunday, Holy Thursday, Ecstor Eve, as well as the different
Ohants for the “Gloria in excelsis? “ Ite Missa est‚'' and ‘⁴ Bene-
dicamus Domino :'' and to the Processional‚ the Responsories for
tho Purification, Ecstor Day and the two days following, Trinity
Sunday, All Souls’ Day, and others.

All the mors important variatione from the text of the printed
Manual are noted in this edition. The collation of the Calendar
